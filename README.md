# Fourier Laboratory

The problem addressed in this repository is the development of a wearable device that can be worn by a person and is capable of acquiring ECG and accelerometer signals, and transmitting them to a computer via Bluetooth.

## Activities carried out

- Design of circuits for the conditioning and amplification of ECG signals prior to sampling.
- Signal acquisition. Time-domain and frequency-domain analysis.
- ECG signal processing. Peak detection. Heart rate estimation.
- Accelerometer signal processing. Extraction of relevant features.
- Use of classification algorithms. Training of classifiers based on the features extracted from acceleration signals for motion state recognition.
- Implementation of an end-to-end solution integrating acquisition, processing, and classification modules.
